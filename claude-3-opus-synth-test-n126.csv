COMPARISON: There are no prior mammograms available for comparison.

FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense. There are scattered benign-appearing calcifications in both breasts. There is a 0.7 cm cluster of pleomorphic calcifications in the right breast at 10 o'clock, 3 cm from the nipple. No architectural distortion or suspicious masses.

368,"BILATERAL DIGITAL MAMMOGRAMS WITH ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF LEFT BREAST AND ULTRASOUND LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY REGION. 
 
HISTORY: 45 year old female with a palpable lump in her left breast at 9 o'clock position. 
 
FINDINGS: The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses.  
In the left breast, there is a 2.5 cm irregular mass at the 9 o'clock position, 4 cm from the nipple which corresponds to the palpable finding. The mass demonstrates spiculated margins and associated architectural distortion. Several pleomorphic microcalcifications are seen within and adjacent to the mass.
Targeted ultrasound of the left breast 9 o'clock mass shows an irregular hypoechoic mass with angulated margins and posterior acoustic shadowing, measuring 25 x 21 x 20 mm. The mass is highly suggestive of malignancy.
Ultrasound of the left axilla reveals enlarged abnormal appearing lymph nodes with thickened cortices and loss of fatty hila, the largest measuring 15 mm in cortical thickness, suspicious for metastatic involvement.  
The right breast shows no dominant mass, architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Highly suspicious mass left breast at 9 o'clock position with adjacent pleomorphic microcalcifications, likely representing malignancy. Ultrasound findings corroborate mammographic impression. Recommend tissue sampling.
2. Abnormal left axillary lymph nodes suspicious for metastatic involvement.  
3. BI-RADS Category 5: Highly Suggestive of Malignancy.
 
ADDENDUM: Ultrasound guided core biopsy of the left 9 o'clock breast mass and fine needle aspiration of the most abnormal appearing left axillary lymph node were performed. Pathology results demonstrate invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, in the left breast mass and metastatic carcinoma in the left axillary lymph node.",Positive

INDICATION: 56 year-old woman with newly diagnosed left breast cancer.

TECHNIQUE: Standard CC and MLO views were obtained bilaterally. Magnification images with a small focal compression paddle were then performed in mediolateral and craniocaudal projections of an area of microcalcifications in the upper outer right breast.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: 
The breasts are heterogeneously dense (type C). 

The left breast shows an irregular spiculated hyperdense mass measuring 2.3 cm located at 2 o'clock position, 4 cm from the nipple. Associated architectural distortion is also seen. The lesion was targeted under ultrasound and appears highly suspicious for malignancy (BI-RADS 5). No other suspicious masses, areas of asymmetry or distortion are seen in the left breast. The left skin is normal in thickness and there is no nipple retraction.

In the right breast, there is a cluster of pleomorphic microcalcifications in the right upper outer quadrant measuring 6 mm at 9 o'clock, 6 cm from the nipple (group 4). These are seen on both CC and MLO views. Additional magnification views confirm these calcifications are suspicious for malignancy (BI-RADS 4B). The remainder of the right breast shows only scattered areas of benign calcifications. No masses, architectural distortion, or skin thickening are seen on the right.

There are no abnormally enlarged axillary lymph nodes bilaterally.

IMPRESSION:
