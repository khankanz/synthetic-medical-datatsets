       "- BILATERAL DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM FOR SCREENING. CLINICAL HISTORY: 51-year-old female presents for her screening mammogram. No family history of breast cancer. Patient reports no personal history of breast cancer. Patient has extremely dense breasts clinically. TECHNIQUE: Standard CC and MLO views were obtained. COMPARISON: Comparison is made to the patient's prior mammogram dated 12/27/2023. FINDINGS: The breasts are extremely dense. There is no mammographic evidence of a suspicious mass, architectural distortion, or suspicious calcifications. IMPRESSION: 1. Extremely dense breast tissue. Mammography is less accurate in women with dense breasts. This means that cancers may be missed that would be seen with mammography in women with average density breasts. We strongly encourage you to talk to your doctor about your dense breast tissue. 2. No mammographic evidence of malignancy. 3. BI-RADS Category 2: Benign finding. ➡ *Negative*\n",

       "ADDENDUM: Breast density notification - Your mammogram indicates that you have dense breast tissue. Dense breast tissue is relatively common and is found in about 40 percent of women. Dense breast tissue can make it more difficult to detect cancers in the breast by mammography because it can hide small abnormalities. Dense breast tissue may also be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This information is being provided to raise your awareness of the impact of breast density on cancer detection. For further information about dense breast tissue, as well as other breast cancer risk factors, please see the resources available on our practice website. ➡ *Not Stated*\n",
