CLINICAL HISTORY: Annual screening mammogram. Patient denies breast pain, skin changes or nipple discharge.
TECHNIQUE: Standard CC and MLO views of both breasts were obtained. 
COMPARISON: Comparison is made to outside screening mammogram from 1 year prior.
FINDINGS:
Right breast: The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense (type C). This may lower the sensitivity of mammography. No dominant mass, architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications are identified. 
Left breast: The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense (type C). This may lower the sensitivity of mammography. No dominant mass, architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications are identified.
IMPRESSION:

2. Heterogeneously dense breast tissue which could obscure detection of small masses. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Routine annual screening mammography is recommended in 1 year. Clinical breast examination is also recommended.
2. Please inform the patient that her breast tissue is dense. Dense breast tissue is very common and is not abnormal. However, dense breast tissue can make it harder to find cancer on a mammogram and may also be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This information is given to raise awareness and to inform her medical care decisions. A report of the results was sent to the patient and referring provider.

32,"ULTRASOUND GUIDED LEFT BREAST BIOPSY
 
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: 67-year-old female with suspicious 8 mm cluster of microcalcifications at 2:00, 6 cm from the nipple on screening mammogram. 

TECHNIQUE: With the patient in the supine position, the skin overlying the area of interest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia. Using ultrasound guidance, an 18-gauge spring-loaded biopsy device was used to obtain 5 core biopsy specimens from the area of microcalcifications in the 2:00 axis of the left breast, 6 cm from the nipple. The specimens were placed in formalin and sent to pathology for analysis. A titanium clip was deployed at the biopsy site. The skin was then cleansed and Steri-strips were applied for closure. The patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications.

The previously noted 6 x 4 mm cyst at 9 o'clock right breast is stable. No other new or suspicious findings in the right breast.
The left breast demonstrates no suspicious mammographic findings.
IMPRESSION:
RIGHT BREAST: BI-RADS Category 4B: Suspicious microcalcifications in the upper outer right breast. Stereotactic biopsy is recommended. Requisition to be faxed to breast imaging.
LEFT BREAST: BI-RADS Category 1: Normal. Annual screening recommended.",Positive
194,"BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM WITH ADDITIONAL VIEWS LEFT BREAST:

INDICATION: Evaluate for multifocal disease in patient with biopsy-proven invasive ductal carcinoma at 3:00 left breast. Outside ultrasound-guided core biopsy demonstrated invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, ER/PR positive, HER2 negative.

TECHNIQUE: Standard CC and MLO views were obtained bilaterally. Spot compression magnification views were performed of the left breast at the site of the known malignancy. 

COMPARISON: Outside mammogram from 4 months prior.

FINDINGS:
The breasts are heterogeneously dense which may limit sensitivity. 

LEFT BREAST: 
In the upper outer left breast, there is a new 12 mm cluster of fine pleomorphic calcifications at 2:00, 6 cm from the nipple. This corresponds to the site of the known malignancy. Magnification views confirm the presence of a suspicious cluster of calcifications. 

At 3:00 in the left breast, there is an oval circumscribed mass measuring 10 mm. This was stable compared to the outside prior mammogram and likely represents a benign finding such as a fibroadenoma. 

The remainder of the left breast is unremarkable. The skin is normal in thickness. The nipple is normal in configuration. No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy.

RIGHT BREAST:
There are no dominant masses, areas of architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications in the right breast. Stable benign-appearing calcifications are noted. The skin is normal in thickness. The nipple is normal in configuration. No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Highly suspicious cluster of pleomorphic calcifications at 2:00 in the left breast corresponding to the site of known biopsy-proven invasive ductal carcinoma. Additional disease in the upper outer left breast.
2. Probably benign mass in the left breast at 3:00, likely a fibroadenoma. Recommend clinical and imaging follow-up for this finding. 
3. No suspicious mammographic findings in the right breast. 

BI-RADS CATEGORY 4 LEFT BREAST
BI-RADS CATEGORY 2 RIGHT BREAST

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Surgical consultation for management of the known invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast as well as the additional site of suspicious calcifications. Short-term follow-up of the benign mass at 3:00 in the left breast could be considered if the patient does not undergo mastectomy.",Positive
195,"BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM AND ULTRASOUND OF THE BREASTS:

INDICATION: Palpable lump in the right breast. High risk family history of breast cancer.

FINDINGS:
Heterogeneously dense breasts (ACR category D).

Right Breast:
In the lower inner quadrant at 4:00, 6 cm from the nipple there is an irregularly shaped mass measuring 21 x 18 x 16 mm with spiculated margins and posterior acoustic shadowing. The mass corresponds to the palpable finding. Associated with the mass are several groups of pleomorphic microcalcifications extending anteriorly. No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy. 

Left Breast:
No significant masses, architectural distortion or suspicious calcifications. Ultrasound shows a 5 mm simple cyst at 2:00.

IMPRESSION:
Highly suspicious mass at 4:00 lower inner right breast (BIRADS 5) with associated pleomorphic microcalcifications. Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy is recommended for definitive diagnosis. 

The remainder of both breasts are negative (BIRADS 1). 

ADDENDUM - ULTRASOUND GUIDED CORE BIOPSY RIGHT BREAST 4:00:
The suspicious mass in the right lower inner breast underwent ultrasound guided core needle biopsy using a 14 gauge needle. Specimen radiograph confirmed calcifications within the samples. The biopsy was technically adequate and specimens were submitted to pathology. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Skin marking placed. Follow up with referring physician to discuss results and management.",Positive
